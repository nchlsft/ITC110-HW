p. 171 #21 & Practice problem “Regex of Strip()” checked into Github, checked by group

How would you write a regex that matches a sentence where the first
word is either Alice, Bob, or Carol; the second word is either eats, pets, or
throws; the third word is apples, cats, or baseballs; and the sentence ends
with a period? This regex should be case-insensitive. It must match the
following:
• 'Alice eats apples.'
• 'Bob pets cats.'
• 'Carol throws baseballs.'
• 'Alice throws Apples.'
• 'BOB EATS CATS.'

but not the following:
• 'RoboCop eats apples.'
• 'ALICE THROWS FOOTBALLS.'
• 'Carol eats 7 cats.'

re.compile(r'(Alice|Bob|Carol)\s(eats|pets|throws)\s(apples|cats|baseballs)\.', re.IGNORECASE)

Regex Version of strip()
Write a function that takes a string and does the same thing as the strip()
string method. If no other arguments are passed other than the string to
strip, then whitespace characters will be removed from the beginning and
end of the string. Otherwise, the characters specified in the second argument
to the function will be removed from the string.

import re
string = input("Enter a string to strip: ")
bad_chars = input("Enter the characters you want to be striped: ")
def regex_strip(string, bad_chars):
    strip_regex = re.compile('[%s]' % bad_chars)
    return strip_regex.sub('', string)
try:
    print(regex_strip(string, bad_chars))
except TypeError:
    print(regex_strip(string, ' '))
    

# I wasn't able to achieve this by myself, I did some exploring on github to find some code that would be helpful, but still not sure if i'm fully understanding this.
