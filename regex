p. 171 #21 & Practice problem “Regex of Strip()” checked into Github, checked by group

How would you write a regex that matches a sentence where the first
word is either Alice, Bob, or Carol; the second word is either eats, pets, or
throws; the third word is apples, cats, or baseballs; and the sentence ends
with a period? This regex should be case-insensitive. It must match the
following:
• 'Alice eats apples.'
• 'Bob pets cats.'
• 'Carol throws baseballs.'
• 'Alice throws Apples.'
• 'BOB EATS CATS.'
but not the following:
• 'RoboCop eats apples.'
• 'ALICE THROWS FOOTBALLS.'
• 'Carol eats 7 cats.'
